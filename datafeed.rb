# Author..............: Pierre-Yves Lapersonne
# Version.............: 2.0.0
# Since...............: 21/03/2018
# Description.........: Receives HTTP requests and parse them so as to feed with data.
#                       Uses the core's Shell script to make the queries.
#
# Usage: ruby datafeed.rb
#
# Samples of requests:
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/getAll
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/filterAll?filter=Apple
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/filterTools?filter=Android
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/filterWebs?filter=BTC
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/filterDevices?filter=Huawei
# => http://SERVER_ADDRESS:PORT/filterSocs?filter=Kirin
#
# Example of CURL command for tests:  curl  -X GET "http://localhost:4343/filterAll?filter=charts"
#
